The question is on the link https://github.com/notonthehighstreet/gilded-rose

I picked Javascript language and the above repo has Jasemine test framework in the code base.

Since I am more familiar with JEST , I installed JEST in this code base.

I wrote the test cases after understanding the problem and made sure everything passed.

Once each and every test case passed, then I started refactoring the code .

While refactoring the code , I followed SOLID principles , abstraction , reusability and maintainability. 

# Instructions

1. Clone the repo and install package dependencies `npm i`. Make sure latest version of node is installed in your system.

2. Run `npm test` for testing all the scenarios.

3. Run `npm run start` to run the main file
